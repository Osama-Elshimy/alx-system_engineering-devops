## Postmortem Report: The Day Our Database Took a Siesta

### Issue Summary

**Duration:**  
Start: July 12, 2024, 14:00 GMT+2  
End: July 12, 2024, 16:30 GMT+2

**Impact:**  
Our beloved e-commerce platform decided to take an unscheduled siesta, causing 60% of users to experience slow load times and failed transactions. Think of it as a digital siesta gone wrong.

**Root Cause:**  
Our database connection settings were the digital equivalent of leaving your car keys in the fridge. Misconfiguration led to a bottleneck, resulting in increased latency and eventual timeouts.

### Timeline

- **14:00 GMT+2** - Issue detected: Our monitoring alerts screamed for attention with increased response times.
- **14:05 GMT+2** - First responder: On-call engineer confirms the database is taking a nap.
- **14:15 GMT+2** - Initial guess: Blame it on the promotional event traffic spike.
- **14:30 GMT+2** - Misleading path: Web server scaling reviewed and cranked up like a stereo, but nada.
- **15:00 GMT+2** - Call the pros: Incident escalated to our database gurus.
- **15:30 GMT+2** - Sherlock Holmes mode: Database performance metrics show idle connections partying hard.
- **16:00 GMT+2** - Eureka moment: Misconfigured database connection pool size found to be the culprit.
- **16:15 GMT+2** - Fix deployed: Configuration updated and changes rolled out.
- **16:30 GMT+2** - All clear: Service back to normal, no more siestas.

### Root Cause and Resolution

**Root Cause:**  
The database connection pool was set up like a teenager's curfew â€“ too strict on active connections and too lenient on idle ones. This misconfiguration led to a bottleneck, with the application struggling to get new connections during peak traffic.

**Resolution:**  
We fixed the connection pool settings to be more like a responsible adult: increased the number of active connections and reduced the idle threshold. After updating the database configuration file and redeploying, our database was back in action, handling the load like a pro.

### Corrective and Preventative Measures

**Improvements/Fixes:**

- Better monitoring to keep an eye on those sneaky database connections.
- Comprehensive review and update of all critical service configurations.
- Automated alerts for any configuration shenanigans.

**Tasks:**

1. **Patch database server:** Adjust database settings to prevent future siestas.
2. **Add monitoring:** Keep tabs on connection pool metrics with new monitoring tools.
3. **Automated checks:** Develop scripts to regularly check and validate critical configurations.
4. **Training:** Teach engineers the art of database configuration and monitoring.
5. **Documentation:** Update our playbook with best practices for managing database connections and incident response.

By adding a touch of humor, we aim to make this postmortem not only informative but also engaging. Let's ensure our systems are always wide awake and ready for action!
